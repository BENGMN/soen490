%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Done for version 2.3.3 (released 22/12/2007):
  Fixed
    1- remove hack in internal function 'readbin' that used the clone bit as

       taken into account (I = i) [#629]

       but could in fact remain the same ]                                [F81]
   11- agm(-1, 1+1e-55) --> oo loop, agm(-1,1) --> wrong result           [F27]
   12- read("a b.gz")   \\ filename contains a space                      [F34]

   17- exp(2^200*I) --> catastrophic cancellation [cos/sin were OK] [#631][F45]
   18- [Configure] don't rely on $CC exit status, check whether a non-0 size
       executable is produced [ problems with tcc ]                       [F55]
   19- wrong Prototype for subgrouplist [ extra 'p' ]                     [F56]

   21- typo in bnfisintnorm(): missed some solutions  [ couldn't find a unit
       of norm -1 even though one exists ]                                [F74]
   22- dilog(-1) [ more generally polylog of < 0 t_REALs ] should have
