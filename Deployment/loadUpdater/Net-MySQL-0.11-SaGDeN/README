Net::MySQL
==========

Net::MySQL - Pure Perl MySQL network protocol interface.

Net::MySQL is a Pure Perl client interface for the MySQL database.
This module implements network protool between server and client of
MySQL, thus you don't need external MySQL client library like
libmysqlclient for this module to work. It means this module enables
you to connect to MySQL server from some operation systems which MySQL
is not ported. How nifty!

This module has been tested on these OSes.

   * MacOS 9.x with MacPerl 5.6.1r1
   * MacOS X with perl 5.6.0 build for darwin

   * Solaris 2.6 with perl 5.6.1 built for sun4-solaris
   * Solaris 2.6 with perl 5.004_04 built for sun4-solaris

# This list is the environment which I can use by the test usually.
# Net::MySQL will operate also in much environment which is not in a list.

Can use on Solaris2.6 with perl5.004_04, although 'make test' is
failure.
