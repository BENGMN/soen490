This is Crypt::IDEA version 1.06, an XS-based implementation of the
patent-encumbered IDEA cryptography algorithm.  It's designed
to take full advantage of Crypt::CBC when desired.  This module builds
on many plaforms, with a little assistance (although this should be
more rare now).

Prerequisites
-------------

For the full test suite to run, Crypt::CBC, version 1.22 or higher
is required (recommended is 1.25 or higher), however this module 
is not mandatory for standalone IDEA use.  

Installing Crypt::IDEA
--------------------------

nothing unusual:

	1. perl Makefile.PL
	2. make
	3. make test
	4. sudo make install
