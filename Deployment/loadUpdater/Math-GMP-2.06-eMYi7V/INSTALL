** Notes for AIX **

tswd13@yahoo.com notes on bug #11736 about installing on AIX 5.2:

First, I had to modify the Makefile.PL so that it could see the gmp libraries by adding "-L/usr/local/lib" as below:

'LIBS' => ['-L/usr/local/lib -lgmp'], # e.g., '-lm'

Then, I had to change the following line in GMP.c and GMP.xs from:

#include "gmp.h"
to:
#include </usr/local/include/gmp.h>

Reinstalled gmp-4.1.4 with:

./configure ABI=32 --disable-static


** Notes for OSX **

Rob writes on bug #19262:

Error:
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libgmp.a(mode1o.o) has local relocation entries in non-writable section (__TEXT,__text)

Solution:
Edit the Makefile, adding the following to LDDLFLAGS:
-read_only_relocs suppress
